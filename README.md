# üìÅ Automated File Upload & Processing Workflow (n8n)

This workflow monitors a Google Drive folder for new files, sends them to an external processing API, stores the processed output in another Drive folder, writes metadata to Google Sheets, and deletes the original file. It uses environment variables for flexible configuration and security.
